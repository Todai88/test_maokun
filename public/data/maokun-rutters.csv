						[There is a hiatus in respect of the voyage to Ling shan [Cape Varella]; 'Shunfeng' gives the stages as 5 watches from Chikan shan [Point Ke Ga] to Luowantou [Cape Padaran, 11 22' N], 5 watches to Qienanmao shan [Hon Heo mountain, 12 24' N, 109 16 E], 3 watches to Ling shan [Cape Varella, 12 54' N].]		
						[Since Zheng He or his delegate often went to Thailand, we set out the main stages (as given in 'Shun-feng') for the voyages from Grand Condore to Thailand and thence to Pedra Branca on the main route to India. From Kunlun shan [Grand Condore, 106 36' E], 3 watches to Xiao Kunlun shan [The Brothers, 106 07' E]; 8 watches to Zhenxu shan [Non Khoai, 104 49' E]. From Zhenxu shan, 10 watches to Daheng shan [Poulo Panjang, 103 23' E]; 5 watches to Xiaoheng shan [Poulo Wai, 102 51' E]; 20 watches to Bijiashan [Khao Samroiyot 12 14' N]; 10 watches to Wuniqian [the mudbank off Hlaem Phak Bia, 13 01' N]. From Wuniqian, 3 watches to Zhuxu [the mudbank off Ban Hlaem village, 13 12' N]; and 5 watches to the shallows [off Maenam Mae Klong, 13 21' N]. On the southward journey ships followed the coast from KhaoSamroiyou; 5 watches to Guishan [Ko Hluam, 11 45' N]; 10 watches to Fuoxu [Ko lang, 10 51' N]. From Fuoxu, 10 watches to Da Sumeishan [Ko Samui, 9 27' N]; 15 watches to Daimeishan [Ko Krah, 8 25' N]; 10 watches to Suguna [Songkhla, 7 11' N]; 5 watches to Danijiang kou [Pattani river estuary, 6 54' N].

From Qupanshan, 11 watches to Baijiao [Pedra Branca, 1 19' N].		
						From Jilimen [Little Karimun island, 103 24' E], for 5 watches the ship steers 105-120 and [then] exactly 120, makes Changyao xu [Pulau Satumu, Raffles Lighthouse], and goes out through Longya strait. From Longya strait, steering 75-90 [f. 15] for 5 watches, the ship makes Baijiao [Pedra Branca, 104 24' E].		
						[The map contains no sailing directions; we can, however, set out the main stages derived from other sources. From Ling shan [Cape Varella, 12 54' N] 13 watches to Dongxidong [Great Catwick and Poulo Sapatu, 9 59' N]; 45 watches to Dongshelong shan [Tandjung Datu, 2 05' N]; 11 watches to Jialimada [Karimata island, 1 36' S]; 10 watches to Jiaolan shan [Gelam islet, 2 53' S]; 30 watches to Jilimen shan [Karimundjawa islands, 5 52' S]; 4 watches to Baolao'an shan [Djapara mountain, that is, Murjo Pegunungan, 6 35' S, 110 52' E]; 8 watches to Nacan shan [Lasem Pegunungan, 111 31' E]; 2 watches to Duban shan [Tuban, 112 04' E]; and 5 watches to Xincun [Gresik, 7 09' S, 112 39' E], or alternatively to Raodong [Jaratan].]		
						[The map contains no sailing directions. 'Shun-feng' (ff. 43-5) gives directions for voyages from Atjeh in Sumatra in Banten in Java, and we attempt a provisional explanation of the main stages. From Aqi [Atjeh, Kutaradja], 1 watch to Mantu mountain [Udjung Masam Muka, 5 35' N, 95 13' E]], 39 watches to Maolu [Barus, 2 01' N], 19 watches to Kuxin man anchorage [Tiku, 0 23' S], 3 watches to Zhiqumian [Pariaman, 0 42' S], 3 watches to Jializai man [Padang, 0 57' S], 11 watches to Jiliman [Inderapura, 2 04' S], 14 watches to Foulu luo [Bengkulu, 3 47' S], 19 watches to Jiliman xu [Batu Ketjil island, 5 53' S, 104 27' E]], 5 watches to Fouluwu xu [Sebesi island in Sunda strait, 105 29' E], 3 watches to Foulu shang xiang [Sangian island, 105 50' E], 4 watches to the great mountain of Shigong [Gede mountain near Tandjung Sekong, 5 54' S, 105 59' E]], thence to Pan-jang [Pandjang island, 5 55' S] in Banten bay.		
						[The map contains no sailing directions for the west coast of Thailand and Burma with the Nicobar and Andeman islands. The 'Shun-feng' (f. 46) gives the stages for the journey from Kuala Pasai to Chittagong, and we attempt a provisional explanation. From Kuala Pasai, 12 watches to Qienanmao shan [Poulo Weh], 45 watches to the 'southern head mountain' of Andeman [Mount Mayo, 11 23' N, on Rutland island], 12 watches to Pingzhongjian [Saddle Hill,, 13 09' N, on North Andaman island], 50 watches to Chitu shan [South cliff, 21 20' N, on the coast of Burma], 5 watches to Rangliedang head [Patenga point, 22 13' N, associated with 'Juldia' hill], near Chadijiang [Chittagong].		
						[Huang Shengzeng (Xiyang chaogong dianlu, ch. 2, ff. 7-7v) records an interesting itinerary from Bengal to Male island, which we paraphrase and summarize. From Bengal the navigator descends to latitudes where the altitude of Polaris is, successively, 4.5 fingers, 3.5 fingers, 2 3/8 fingers, 2 1/8 fingers, 1 7/8 fingers, and 1 3/4 fingers; then he passes Yinggezui [Namunakuli in Ceylon] mountain; after 5 watches he sees Tiezhen island [Great Basses reef]; after another 7 watches he sees Fuoshzuo mountain [Dondra head]; after anohter 5 watches he sees the mountain of Yali [Galle]; whence he travels to Guanxu [Male island in the Maldives].]
